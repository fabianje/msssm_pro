The following videos are available:
> * simulation 1: intersection without using optimization methods (initial case)
> * simulation 2: intersection with roundabout, inverse roundabout and traffic lanes (best case)
All the simulation are done with a simulation time of 55s and a pedestrian generation rate of 0.005.
To each simulation corresponds a pdf.file that represents the averaged velocity distribution (white indicates a velocity of zero).
